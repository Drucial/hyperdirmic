# Hyperdirmic Script

## Overview

The Hyperdirmic script is designed to automatically organize files by type across designated directories such as Desktop and Downloads. It helps in maintaining cleanliness and order by automatically moving files into predefined folders based on their extensions.

## How It Works

The script utilizes the Python Watchdog library to monitor changes in specified directories and reacts to the creation of new files. Depending on the file extension, the script moves files to respective folders, such as TextFiles, Images, etc., within the Downloads directory.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pip
- git (for cloning the repository)

## Installation

To install Hyperdirmic, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Drucial/hyperdirmic.git
cd hyperdirmic
```

2. **Run the Install Script**:

```bash
./scripts/install.sh
```

This will set up the virtual environment, install necessary dependencies, configure the launch agent, and add utility commands to your `.zshrc`.

## Uninstallation

To uninstall Hyperdirmic, follow these steps:

1. **Run the Uninstall Script**:

```bash
./scripts/uninstall.sh
```

This will stop any running Hyperdirmic processes, remove the launch agent, delete the virtual environment, and remove utility commands from your `.zshrc`.

## Utility Commands

After installation, you can use the following utility commands:

- **To kill the running `hyperdirmic` process**:
  ```bash
  killhyperdirmic
  ```
- **To view the standard output log**:
  ```bash
  loghyperdirmic
  ```
- **To view the standard error log**:
  ```bash
  errorhyperdirmic
  ```
- **To view the debug log**:
  ```bash
  debughyperdirmic
  ```
- **To view all logs combined**:
  ```bash
  allhyperdirmiclogs
  ```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, please check the logs using the `loghyperdirmic`, `errorhyperdirmic`, `debughyperdirmic`, and `allhyperdirmiclogs` commands.

## Development Environment Setup

1. **Create a virtual environment:**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```

2. **Activate the virtual environment:**

   - On macOS/Linux:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

    - On Windows:

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Running Tests:**

   ```bash
   pytest
   ```

5. **Linting and Formatting:**

   ```bash
   flake8
   black .
   ```

## Conclusion

The Hyperdirmic script automates file organization tasks, making it easier to keep your desktop and downloads directory well-organized without manual intervention.
